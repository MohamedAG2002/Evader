# Evader
Evade the traps whilst you are trying to run away from the ever-growing beast. Who or what is that beast? Perhaps it is your fears? Your greed? Your lust? Who knows? And who cares? Just run away! While you're running away from the beast, try and get a high score so you can impress your friends and family and finally make them proud of you on...something, just anything.

## How to use
You can look at the source code if it intresets you, though it is not very intersting. Nonetheless, if you want to clone project you're free to do so. However, if you want to just play the game go to my *itch.io* page to download and play the game.
